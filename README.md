# [Cleaning E-commerce data using python](https://github.com/Cassamajor-Wany/Cleaning-data-using-python)
In this projet I used **python** to clean an E-Commerce dataset.

This project give me the oppertunity to practice my skills in a **business environment* and on a large set of the **data cleaning and wrangling** steps.
The steps practiced in this project are :
- Handling NA
- Duplicated values
- Textuel data cleaning
- Handling data types
- Outliers
- Rename columns

## Tools
- Pandas
- Re
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

# [Data visualization of car price](https://github.com/Cassamajor-Wany/Data-visualization-of-influences-on-car-price/tree/main)
Using a dataset of car sell in USA, I used data visualization to answer **business question**.
After an introduction to the market, I developped **straightforward visualization** in **Power BI** to show what influence the price of a car in the dataset market

# [Experimenting AI and webscrapping to perform competitor analysis](https://github.com/Cassamajor-Wany/Experimenting-AI-and-webscrapping-to-perform-competitor-analysis)
In this projetc I used **web scrapping** on the website **Trustpilot** to accumulate 1600 bad reviews of two competitor, Hostinger and Bleuhost. And additionnals informations such as the date and location. Then, with a AI model I was able to **automaticly associat** a complain category to each reviews. Which will allow me to perform a competitor analysis, highlighting what customers complain the most about those companies.

## AI Model
The task we want to do is **Zero shot classification** of text data.
The model used is **Comprehend-it-base** by Knowledgator. This is a model based on DeBERTaV3-base that was trained on natural language inference datasets as well as on multiple text classification datasets. It demonstrates better quality on the diverse set of text classification datasets in a zero-shot setting than Bart-large-mnli while being almost **3 times smaller**. Moreover, the model can be used for multiple information extraction tasks in zero-shot setting.

## Tools
- Selenium
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
